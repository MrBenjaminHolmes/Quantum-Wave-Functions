# 🌀 Time-Dependent 1D Infinite Potential Well

Visualize the **time-dependent wavefunctions** and **probability densities** of a particle in a 1D infinite potential well. This simulation animates how the wavefunction evolves over time.  

## ✨ Features

- Compute **wavefunctions** Ψₙ(x, t)  
- Visualize **real and imaginary parts** of the wavefunction  
- Display **probability density** |Ψₙ(x, t)|²  
- Calculate **energy levels** in Joules and electron-volts  
- Animate wavefunction evolution over time  
- Verify normalization with ∫₀ᴸ |Ψ(x,t)|² dx
